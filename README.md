# Carbon Emissions Impact Analysis with Python


In this analysis, we aim to explore the impact of carbon emissions on global temperatures. The focus will be on identifying historical trends, detecting anomalies, and simulating potential future scenarios to understand how changes in CO₂ concentrations influence temperature anomalies.

For this, we will work with two primary datasets:

1. One containing annual temperature changes across multiple countries and decades,
2. Another featuring monthly CO₂ concentrations measured globally.

By combining these datasets, we will investigate correlations, detect patterns over decades, and use predictive modelling to simulate “what-if” scenarios. This data-driven approach will provide actionable insights into the connection between carbon emissions and climate change, which can offer valuable context for sustainable policy-making.
